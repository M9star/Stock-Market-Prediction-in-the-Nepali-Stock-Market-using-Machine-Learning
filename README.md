## üí° Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the exciting world of stock market prediction using machine learning in the context of the Nepali stock market. In this project, we explore the application of advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict trends in the Nepali stock market. The use of machine learning allows us to leverage historical stock data, identify patterns, and make informed predictions, contributing to more informed investment decisions.

## üéì What are we doing<a name="what-are-we-doing"></a>
Our primary objective is to develop and implement machine learning models that can predict stock prices in the Nepali market. By harnessing the power of data and advanced algorithms, we aim to provide valuable insights to investors, traders, and financial analysts. The project involves exploring various machine learning models, fine-tuning them, and evaluating their performance on real-world Nepali stock data.
